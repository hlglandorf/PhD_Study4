# PhD Study4
This repository holds R code from my fourth PhD study that examined the relationship between athlete burnout, biomarkers, and a number of health variables (depressive symptoms, sleep disruptions/insomnia symptoms, physical symptoms) over three waves with multilevel mediation models.

For context, the pre-registration for the study can be found here (Glandorf et al., 2023): https://doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.13251

The paper is currently in the editing stage and thus code may change/does not represent the final version. 

The data is available upon request. 

The code is separated into several files:
1. Data joining: This file joins the questionnaire data and biomarker data (from waves 1-3) into a single file
2. Analysis: This file carries out the descriptive and inferential statistics of the planned analysis (multilevel mediation analysis via maximum likelihood models)
3. Exploratory Analysis (Part 1): This file carries out exploratory moderation analyses
4. Exploratory Analysis (Part 2): This file carries out exploratory latent growth curve models
5. Exploratory Analysis (Part 3a): This file carries out exploratory multilevel mediation models with a Bayesian estimator and priors (biomarkers as simultaneous mediators, paper version)
6. Exploratory Analysis (Part 3b): This file carries out exploratory multilevel mediation models with a Bayesian estimator and priors (biomarkers as mediators in individual models, thesis version)
